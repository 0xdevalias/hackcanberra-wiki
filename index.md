# Hack Canberra Wiki

Welcome to Hack Canberra! Even though we're a small city, and there seems to be at most 2 degrees of seperation (aka 'the canberra effect') I know for a fact that a lot of the cool/interesting stuff around here just flies under the radar for most people.

This is a community effort to document and shine some light on the cool things happening in and around Canberra related to [startups](general/startups-entrepreneurs.md), [hacker/coworking spaces](general/coworking-hacker-spaces.md), technology, design, business, Goverment 2.0 and all manner of other interesting stuff.

Something missing that ought to be here? [Send us a pull request](https://github.com/alias1/hackcanberra-wiki)! We're all modern and cool like that.
